      <description>Hi! Here is a brief introduction to the project BioInterns.
Why BioInterns?  Aim: We want to inform university students of Biology/Biotechnology (but not only!) about the opportunities to do research during the Summer period in prestigious universities all over the world. All opportunities offered on BioInterns are paid for.
  How it all started: Many students in Biology/Biotechnology can&#39;t wait to gain first hand research experience. Unfortunately, practical courses in a degree course usually involve overcrowded teaching laboratories where it is difficult to understand what doing scientific research actually entails.</description>
